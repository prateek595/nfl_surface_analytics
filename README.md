# Problem statement

 to investigate the relationship between the playing surface and the injury and performance of National Football League (NFL) athletes and to examine factors that may contribute to lower extremity injuries.


## Data Files
There are three files provided in the dataset, as described below:

Injury Record: The injury record file in .csv format contains information on 105 lower-limb injuries that occurred during regular season games over the two seasons. Injuries can be linked to specific records in a player history using the PlayerKey, GameID, and PlayKey fields.

Play List: – The play list file contains the details for the 267,005 player-plays that make up the dataset. Each play is indexed by PlayerKey, GameID, and PlayKey fields. Details about the game and play include the player’s assigned roster position, stadium type, field type, weather, play type, position for the play, and position group.

Player Track Data: player level data that describes the location, orientation, speed, and direction of each player during a play recorded at 10 Hz (i.e. 10 observations recorded per second).
